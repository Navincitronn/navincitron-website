            <hr>
            <p>I created this website to host and archive my overall work consisting of '.mp3' instrumental files. In my spare time, I select various albums and utilize Demucs Music Source Separation along with Adobe Audition to isolate tracks into their individual components such as vocals, guitars, piano, bass, and drums. I do this for three primary reasons: to provide instrumental versions of entire albums not commonly available on major platforms, to appreciate the musicianship that might be overshadowed by vocals in regular mixes, and just to have easy-listening music for work/study (which I feel music with vocals doesn't suit as well).</p>
            <p>The process for makign each instrumental involves converting YouTube links to .wav files, separating lower bass to middle treble frequencies using Demucs, fine-tuning remaining upper frequencies and correcting any leakage using Adobe Audition, and then encoding the finished workfile as .mp3 or .wav files.</p>

            <p>As for myself briefly, I am a dedicated music enthusiast. I have been meticulously following and listening through my own compiled list of 3400+ albums spanning from 1926 to present day in chronological order of their release dates, to which I also collect each album on vinyl. Additionally, I have been exploring a chronological list of movies, though to a lesser extent.</p>
            <p>All in all, thank you for taking the time to explore my site.</p>
